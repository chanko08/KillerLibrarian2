# Killer Librarian 2: Vengeance

## Story Synopsis
Little kids accidently toppled a stack of books over you while there happened to
be a solar eclipse ... and all the planets were aligned with each other.
This has cursed you to become a vampire upon dying under the stack of books.
Now your one mission is to convert all your patrons into slaves for you and
your kingdom (library).

## Gameplay Synopsis
If you have ever played Hocus Pocus (an old game), then it will be similar to that.
Throw books to stun people, and then suck their blood to heal up.
Levels are kind of bigish, with possible secret areas (maybe a stretch goal?)
