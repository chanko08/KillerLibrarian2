## Killer Librarian 2: Vengeance ##
Little kids accidentally toppled a stack of books over you while there happened to
be a solar eclipse ... and all the planets were aligned with each other.
This has cursed you to become a vampire upon dying under the stack of books.
Now your one mission is to destroy all the patrons of your surprisingly large
library, and to collect the books they are guarding (reading).

## Controls ##
If you have ever played Hocus Pocus (an old game), then it will be similar to that.

* Left Control Key - throw library cards
* Space Key - jump
* Arrow Keys -  move


## Credits ##
Programming, the arguably beautiful abstract art, and the symphony of sounds all
created by [Alex Bechanko](https://twitter.com/chanko08)

## The Code ##
The code is available on [github](https://github.com/chanko08/KillerLibrarian2) with
the MIT License.
The run the code you need to have [Love2d)(www.love2d.org) version 0.9.2 or greater
(although greater has not been tested)
For Linux users, provided that Love2d is on you path you can simply run
`love /path/to/folder` and that will start the game.
